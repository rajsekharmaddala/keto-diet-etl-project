# keto-diet-etl-project
This is an ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) Data Pipeline project using Keto Diet API from Rapid API. In this we extracted the data from the Keto Diet API through requests and stored it on AWS S3 bucket using boto3 library, then transformed the data to desired format using Pandas library, and then finally load it on target S3 folder.
